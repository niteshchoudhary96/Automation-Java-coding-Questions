1. Find Missing Number
Finding a missing number in a sequence is a common problem in automation testing, especially when validating datasets. The approach typically involves calculating the expected sum of numbers and comparing it with the actual sum in the array. Other methods include using XOR operations or sorting techniques to efficiently identify the missing value.
2. Reverse String
Reversing a string is a fundamental operation in Java, often used in automation for validating text transformations or checking palindrome conditions. Common approaches include using loops, StringBuilder's reverse() method, or Java Streams for functional-style reversal.
3. Reverse Integer
Reversing an integer is useful in scenarios like data validation, number formatting, or algorithmic challenges. The process involves extracting digits using modulus and division operations, then reconstructing the number in reverse order. Alternative methods include using recursion or String manipulation techniques.
4. Duplicate String
Detecting duplicate characters or words in a string is essential for data integrity checks, text processing, and automation validations. Solutions range from using nested loops, HashMaps for frequency tracking, or Java Streams for efficient duplicate detection
